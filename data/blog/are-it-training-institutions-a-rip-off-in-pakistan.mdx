<!--Which IT training institution is best in Lahore? Should I do a programming course before I start applying for jobs? Do I need a certificate too?
These are the questions that I get a lot these days. A lot of people -- friends and family; contact me these days to ask for some advice on how and where to apply for a job and these are the questions that I get asked almost every time.

While I get it that people who come from a traditional background of full day schooling and regular physical classes might find it easy to learn from a person standing right in front of them. They can ask questions and get direct feedback right away. They can interact with their peers and that on it's onw is always a big learing opportunity. But my experience as a seasoned developer and being in the industry for about 9 years raises questions of it's own.

Let's discuss if it's a good idea to join an IT training institution for a programming course in Pakistan or not?

Which IT traininng institue is best in Lahore? Do I need to get a certificate for getting a job? Should I do a course form some institute to learn programming? -- These are some of the questions that I get asked a lot these days.

And to be honest, before I started my career, I had those questions as well and that's exactly what I did. I went for a course and got a certificate from a well reputed institute myself. The teacher was amazing, the cours was good for a beginner, I got to know people from the same industry as well. But did I learn programming? Did it help me land a job? Did any IT firm ever asked me for a certificate in interviews? Th answers to all of those questions is a big "NO". And answers to all of the questions mentitoned at the top depends a lot on the course itself. I will explain what that means in a while.

_Before we proceed, please not that this article is based on my own experiences and from people sharing their experiences. None of this is a result of any affiliation with any institute or any platform._

# What are IT Training Institutes?

IT training institutes are special places offering IT trainings and certifications. With IT industry booming a lot these days, they are popping up everywhere. Apart from these institutes, some well known private colleges and universities are offering short courses and trainings for learning computer programming and other IT related skills. In this article, when we refer to IT training institutes, I will be referring to all of this institutions.

# What kind of certificates these institutes offer?

Most of these institutes only offer certificates with their own names on it -- and some of these institutes aren't even registered. So that brings the question of credebility of these certificates. But this question doesn't apply to all the institutes. Some chartered universities offer well credible certificates.

Some institutes also offer programs to prepare for online exams to earn certificates from international institutes. But those programs are quite rare and not a lot of institutes are offering those programs. There could be a lot of solutions to this one problem -- but we'll discuss those in a while. And that brings us to the next question:

# Is staff at these institutes qualified enough for trainings?

This is one of the biggest question -- and currently a concerning point when comes to picking up an institute for learning IT skills -- especially computer programming.

IT training institutes in Pakistan employee people from the IT background, ofcourse. But having a degree in IT doesn't necessarily means that you have mastered IT skills. Which in its own is a big dilemma but a debate for another day.

We all know that teachers are underpaid. Most of the experienced and seasoned teachers at some of the biggest institutes with higher fees, teachers aren't paid quite well at all. While the boom in IT industry, and software export being one of the biggest industries and a growing one at that -- salaries for software engineers are much higher than an average college teacher. So why would a computer programmer quit his job and join a college to teach kids? So where do the teachers come from at these institutes? Let's not base our answer to this question purely out of assumption.

I joined a well reputed institue to learn computer programming a couple of years ago. In the first few days I had realised that the teacher was not a programmer. But this was a question that I couldn't ask directly in the class purely out of respect and not to embarass the teacher. Upon asking the teacher privately -- I got "tagged" and became the target of teacher's bullying in the class. It turns out, the teacher was a student of MCS in GCU. He had no experience working as a programmer and never had done any programming in his career. His only experience was a teacher's assistant and the course that I was enrolled in. I wanted to get a refund and leave the course but I was not allowed to!

On another account, I went to attent a seminar at a very well reputed IT training institute. During the seminar I asked the speaker about his programming background and I was asked to leave the seminar. Upon enquiring the receptionist -- I was told that the instructor is a teacher at a private college and conducts the programming training in his spare time.

Both of these experiences made me do some research of my own and I was unable to find any institute where the programming trainings were actually delivered by experienced programmers.

However, this is not just limited to computer programming. I am sure most of use are familiar with Pakistan's one of the most famous vloggers and video content creator [Azad Chaiwala](https://www.youtube.com/c/AzadChaiwala). I had been following the "King of Business Ideas" since the start on YouTube -- purely for entertainment purposes. A while ago -- Azad Chaiwala raised the same questions that we are discussing here. His solution to the problem was to create a new institute that would address the same issues and also offer cheap courses that locals can afford and get jobs based on those skills.

One of the first courses offered by Azad Chaiwala was video editing. His announcement was quite charming and fun as the rest of his videos. He claimed that the course was being delivered by industry's most famous video editor. But was it true? No. His course was being delivered by one of his editors that he had been employing for his own YouTube channel. Was that person qualified enough for the training? I hope so. But soon enough -- his so called "new kind of institute" fell victim to the same thing as other institutes.

These are some of the many examples but I think we all got the point. Having non-experienced trainers kills the whole point of the training in it's own -- let alone questioning the credebility of the certificates offered.

# Is the training material up to date with current industry trends?
