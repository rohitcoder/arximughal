Which IT training institution is best in Lahore? Should I do a programming course before I start applying for jobs? Do I need a certificate too?
These are the questions that I get a lot these days. A lot of people -- friends and family; contact me these days to ask for some advice on how and where to apply for a job and these are the questions that I get asked almost every time.

While I get it that people who come from a traditional background of full day schooling and regular physical classes might find it easy to learn from a person standing right in front of them. They can ask questions and get direct feedback right away. They can interact with their peers and that on it's onw is always a big learing opportunity. But my experience as a seasoned developer and being in the industry for about 9 years raises questions of it's own.

Let's discuss if it's a good idea to join an IT training institution for a programming course in Pakistan or not?
