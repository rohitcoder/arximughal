Moslty I work in JavaScript echo-system. React is the framework of choice but I've recently started shifting more towards Vue.js. Previously, I have worked with PHP/Laravel as well. I loved WordPress for a very long, but we have parted ways for some time. I do use it for some of my old projects, but it's got it's issues!
